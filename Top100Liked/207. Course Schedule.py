Idea comes from here:
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/discuss/162743/JavaC%2B%2BPython-BFS-Topological-Sorting-O(N-%2B-E)

Instead of using a dic, we store the pairs in a list G: index represents the courses, G[i] represents the courses that require
course i as a prerequisite course. For example: G[3] = [2,4] means course 2 and 4 both require course 3.

degree[] represents how many pre courses a course still needs before we take it.
For example: degree[4] = 3 means we need to take 3 more prerequisite courses before we can take course 4.

We maintain a list zeroDegree: it stores the courses(represented by index) that we can already take which means degree[i] == 0

If len(zeroDegree) == n, we know that we can take all the courses.
Otherwise, return False.
