"""
For example, {1,2,3} intially we have an emtpy set as result [ [ ] ]
Considering 1, if not use it, still [ ], if use 1, add it to [ ], so we have [1] now
Combine them, now we have [ [ ], [1] ] as all possible subset

Next considering 2, if not use it, we still have [ [ ], [1] ], if use 2, just add 2 to each previous subset, we have [2], [1,2]
Combine them, now we have [ [ ], [1], [2], [1,2] ]

Next considering 3, if not use it, we still have [ [ ], [1], [2], [1,2] ], if use 3, just add 3 to each previous subset, we have [ [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3] ]
Combine them, now we have [ [ ], [1], [2], [1,2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3] ]
